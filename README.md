# Optimizing - Agricultural - Production

This Project focuses on building a predictive model so as to suggest the most suitable crops to grow, based on the nature of soil and the given climatic conditions.

# Problem Statement
Agriculture is the art and science of cultivating the soil, growing crops and raising livestock. Agriculture makes us less dependent on other foreign countries as it provides food and also provides income to farmers and revenue to the government.

The dataset contains the conditions for growing different crops.

You need to analyze these conditions and form clusters of crops which helps understand which group of crops require similar kinds of conditions to grow.

# About Dataset

The Dataset Consists of 22 Unique Crops and climatic conditions required to grow the crops. [Eg] Temperature, Humidity, Rainfall. And soil conditions required to grow the crops like Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P), Potassium (K) & PH value of the soil.

# Libraries used in this project

Numpy for Mathematical Calculations

Pandas for DataFrame Manipulations

Seaborn and Matplotlib for Data Visualizations

Sklearn: Used for Machine Learning Algorithms

# Model Building 

Predictive model building using Logistic Regression and evaluate the model performance.
